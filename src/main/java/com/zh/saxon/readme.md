This code contains complete, working examples of both ways to add extension functions to Saxon HE (Home
Edition). Version 9.5 is required since dramatic changes were made after 9.4.

The two Java programs (ext_full.java, ext_simple.java) run Saxon XSLT transformations on normal XSL files,
with the addition of a function written in Java. That function is available in the XSL just like any other
native XSL function. These examples should serve as the basis of novel XSL functions if you need to something
that isn't available in Saxon.

In these examples the XSL script and XML input file are both hardcoded. Perhaps I'll get around to
parameterizing them to make these examples a bit more generalized.

Requirements:

Java

SaxonHE9 (version 9.5)

This has been tested on Linux. It probably works with MacOS and will need minor modifications to work with MS
Windows. If you are using Windows, I suggest that you get cygwin.

Let us assume you have installed saxon9he.jar in the the bin directory in your home directory, in other words:
~/bin or $HOME/bin.

Java is installed somewhere in a standard path. 

This session transcript snippet should explain the location of Java and the PATH environment variable:

    > which java
    /usr/bin/java

    > which javac
    /usr/bin/javac

    > echo $PATH
    /usr/lib64/qt-3.3/bin:/home/twl8n/perl5/perlbrew/bin:/home/twl8n/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.10.1/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/home/twl8n/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/java/latest/bin:/home/twl8n/bin:.



ext_full.java reads ext_full.xsl and dummy.xml. It has an extension function eg:add-two() where the eg
namespace is http://example.com/saxon-extension.

I added an export for CLASSPATH to my .zshrc (bash users would use .bashrc), but I'll explicitly show the
export command below.

This is how I run the program:

    export CLASSPATH=$HOME/bin/saxon9he.jar:$CLASSPATH
    javac ext_full.java
    java ext_full

A session transcript:

    > java ext_full
    format-dateTime: 2013-06-20 09:58:30
    date: 2013-06-20T09:58:30.626-04:00
    add-two: 77



ext_simple.java reads ext_simple.xsl and dummy.xml. It has an extension function eg:sqrt() where the eg
namespace is http://example.com/saxon-extension just as above.

    export CLASSPATH=$HOME/bin/saxon9he.jar:$CLASSPATH
    javac ext_simple.java
    java ext_simple


A session transcript:

    > java ext_simple
    sqrt: 7.0
    format-dateTime: 2013-06-20 09:59:01
    date: 2013-06-20T09:59:01.144-04:00
    sqrt: 7

The hierarchy of inheritance of Java classes and methods is often difficult to navigate, and this has been a
big problem for me with Saxon, so I find it useful to be able to print out a concise list of all available
methods for a given class. generic_demo.java shows how this is done.

    export CLASSPATH=$HOME/bin/saxon9he.jar:$CLASSPATH
    javac generic_demo.java
    java generic_demo

Here is a session transcript with an elipsis (...) where I removed some of the output in the interest of
brevity:
